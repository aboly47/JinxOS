# JinxOS
JinxOS is a fork of an old project I worked on before losing my other account. all development will continue here.

I can't believe how cringe-worthy my old readme was. I've grown as a developer and as a person. *Maybe not so much as a developer. :)*

I'm completely re-writing the project because the code that I started from, localted at [FrOS](https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS/) was written in a way that I couldn't continue doing anymore and I wanted to write this my way.

# What is it?
PowderOS is an operating system I'm working on. for now, it's limited. (Like, really limited.) but I'm planning on developing it as much as I can.

# Components
after the re-write, ShineOS contains the following components:

1. Boot loader :)

# The name?

![Jinx/Powder](./logo.jpeg)

![Jinx/Powder](./logo1.jpeg)

![Jinx/Powder](./logo2.jpeg)

I'm a massive Arcane fan, and Jinx is where the name comes from.

I don't own any of the above images. I found them on Google.
