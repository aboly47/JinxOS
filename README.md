# JinxOS
JinxOS is a fork of an old project I worked on before losing my other account. all development will continue here.
I can't believe how cringe-worthy my old readme was. I've grown as a developer and as a person. *Maybe not so much as a developer. :)*

# What is it?
PowderOS is an operating system I'm working on. for now, it's limited. (Like, really limited.) but I'm planning on developing it as much as I can.

PowderOS is based on [FrOS](https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS/).

# Components
ShineOS contains the following components:
1. Boot loader
2. Operating system kernel, including
    1. ISRs to handle CPU interrupts
    2. VGA driver
    3. Keyboard driver
    4. Shell
    5. Dynamic memory allocation

# Installation guide

in unix like operating systems (like linux and MacOS), install brew and run:

`brew install qemu nasm gcc`

you can also find these packages on other package managers.

now, type:

`cd PATH_TO_POWDEROS`

NOTE: change `PATH_TO_POWDEROS` accordingly.

type:

`make run`

to compile and run the os in qemu.

type:

`make debug` 

for debug purposes,

type:
`make clean` to clean any binary files generated from the compilation.

I'm a massive Arcane fan, and Jinx is where the name comes from.
